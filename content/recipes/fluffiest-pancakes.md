**Dry ingredients:**

-   385g all-purpose flour
-   50g sugar
-   5g salt
-   15g baking powder

**Wet ingredients:**

-   460ml milk
-   60ml neutral seed oil (e.g., sunflower)
-   5g vanilla extract
-   55g apple cider vinegar
-   3 eggs

Mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately. Then mix the two but only really just incorporate the dry ingredients. There should still be lumps. You can start making them immediately.
